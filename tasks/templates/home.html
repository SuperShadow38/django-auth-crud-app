        <p>Hi!!, I'm Fabio √Åvila, a developer backend with python. And this is a web page based on different knowledge acquired in the youtube video "Django crud App", created by the youtuber Fazt (Highly recommended). Thanks to his advice, instructions and so on, I was able to create, model and upload this project, and I was also able to learn about a new technology that helps me to facilitate work, time and also helps me to get more efficient results when operating the backend in web development.</p>
